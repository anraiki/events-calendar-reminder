# Foreword

I recommend using The Events Calendar's Promoter before you opt for this solution. Promoter should takes care of this feature for you but if you need something more hands-on or customized in a particular way, then I hope this coding snippet can help you get there. 

# What does this do?

This is a addon to [The Events Calendar Ticket](https://theeventscalendar.com/wordpress-event-tickets/) plugin

The plugin should remind the user sometime before the event starts.

# Prerequisites

* CRON jobs - Have a web host or server with this feature
* 3rd Party SMTP like Sendgrid 
* Events Calendar Ticket

# Installation

Have the Event Reminder in the WordPress Plugin folder and activate
